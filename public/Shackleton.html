      The Shackleton crater has been closely examined by scientists to better understand whether there is the presence of water on the moon. Shackleton is at the south pole of the moon, with some areas existing in permanent shadow due to the rotation of the Moon. Scientists believed that the poles of the Moon may verify the existence of water as ice could potentially build up in the incredibly cold poles of the moon. The Lunar Prospector mission in 1998 revealed a concentration of hydrogen at the poles, further supporting the possibility that these poles may in fact contain evidence of water. However, the Shackleton crater continues to provide contradictory evidence regarding this. Ultimately, scientists will be unable to determine the existence of water-ice at the poles until samples are extracted from the south pole of the moon.<br><br>
      Shackleton was named after the British explorer Sir Ernest Henry Shackleton. Shackleton famously led three British expeditions to the Antarctic, and was one of the most notable figures in the period called the “Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration”.
