Piccolomini was named after the Italian philosopher and astronomer Alessandro Piccolomini. Piccolomini is most notable for printing the first star atlas, De le stelle fisse, in 1540. This star chart utilized a lettering system for the stars. This work identified each of the 48 Ptolemaic constellations. Notably, Piccolominiâ€™s writings were written in Italian rather than Latin to promote the use of the language in scientific works.
