Mare Orientale means “eastern sea” in Latin, and was not named after a particular scientist. German astronomer Julius Franz considered the crater to be located on the eastern side of teh Moon Scientists have closely studied Orientale on account of its enormous size and its multi-ring structure. Mare Orientale is believed to be the Moon’s most recent impact basin, formed roughly 3.8 billion years ago. During NASA’s Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission, scientists paid special attention to the formation of Orientale to better understand how other impact basins were formed. For example, it was discovered that the rings of Orientale do not represent its initial crater structure. The surface likely rebounded, sending out the rings and eliminating signs of the first impact.
