Aristoteles was named after the Ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle. Aristotle was a scholar of many different subjects, ranging from physics to poetry to politics. For this reason Aristotle is often referred to as the grandfather of science. Aristotle believed in Ptolemy’s “geocentric” theory, arguing that the celestial bodies orbited the Earth rather than the other way around. He argued that the motions of the planets and stars were perfectly circular, orbiting forever. It is important to note that most of Aristotle’s findings in regards to astronomy were incorrect, but served as a foundational legacy for many scientists that came after him.
