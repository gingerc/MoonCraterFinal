      Descartes was named after the French philosopher, mathematician, and scientist Ren√© Descartes. In terms of philosophy, Descartes is most famous for his concept of dualism. This philosophy revolved around the idea that the mind and body were inherently separate, and must be studied as such. Descartes was a strong proponent of the natural sciences, and advocated for the use of reason to further develop it. Descartes as also notable for his enormous impact on geometry and algebra. Notably, Descartes was the first to use variables in equations (like x, y, and z) to describe unknown quantities, which eventually became a core principle in universal mathematics.
