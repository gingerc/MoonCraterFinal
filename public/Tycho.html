Tycho was named after the Danish nobleman and astronomer Tycho Brahe. Tycho Brahe is perhaps most notable for his incredibly accurate astrological observations. Tycho notable worked without the aid of a telescope, using the naked eye to make calculations about the celestial bodies. He correctly ascertained that the planets orbited the Sun and that the Moon orbited the Earth. Despite the fact that Tycho was inaccurate in some of his models and observations, much of his work would prove to be vital for later scientific discoveries. While Tycho believed that the Sun revolved around the Earth (known as “geocentrism”), his work would later be used to verifiably proved that a heliocentric model (the Earth and planets orbiting the sun) was more accurate.
