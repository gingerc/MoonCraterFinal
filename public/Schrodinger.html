Schrödinger was named after the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger. Schrödinger is known as “the father of quantum mechanics” for his research in quantum theory and wave functions. The Schrödinger equation in particular is still actively used to this day, and was incredibly formative at its time of discovery. This equation describes the wave function of a quantum-mechanical system. Schrödinger is additionally famous for his thought experiment, known as “Schrödinger’s cat.” This thought-experiment was used to describe interpretations of quantum mechanics pertaining to a phenomenon known as “quantum superposition.”
