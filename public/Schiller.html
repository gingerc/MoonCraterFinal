    <p>
      Schiller is a particular unusual crater for its elongated shape. Schiller is further elongated because it exists at the Moonâ€™s lunar limb, which is the edge of the visible surface of the Moon. Many small craters exist within the lava-flooded floor. <br><br> 
      Schiller was named after a lawyer from Augsburg, Germany that published the star atlas Coelum Stellatim Christanum in 1627. This star atlas replaced every pagan constellation to be represented by biblical/Christianic figures.
